# Multi-armed-bandits

This project implements a dynamic programming solution to optimize batting decisions in cricket through Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The model helps determine optimal shot selection strategies that balance risk and reward under varying game conditions.

## Key Features

### Dynamic game state modeling considering:
- **Wickets remaining**
- **Balls left in innings**
- **Run-scoring probabilities**
- **Wicket-loss probabilities**

### Risk-reward optimization through:
- **State-value function estimation**
- **Action-value (Q-value) calculations**
- **Bellman equation-based updates**
